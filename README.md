Way more than 8 knots.
I had my character able to lose their wallet. If they don't have it they either have to search, make a deal, or leave it. The deal also changes what you can do. 
For stats there are friendship points with the host. Those change what you can do. There is also how late you are to work stats.
It was an absolute pain but I made sure only information you had was visible. It's really long though so- I have tested this so many times. 
I also added a loop where each time you check a room it gives a different dialogue till it stops except one repeats on purpose.  
I had a fun element with an unreliable narrator so the choices are where the real descriptions come from. It had some interesting effects in certain places.
